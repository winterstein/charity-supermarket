# What is SoGive?

SoGive is a tool that lets you see the impact you’ve made in the world through all your charitable giving. Unlike many other websites that support you with your charitable giving, we will
be comprehensive - i.e. show you not just the giving that you did via SoGive, but also any other giving as well,
and we show you the impact - i.e. what did your giving achieve, not just how much money did you give.

<div class="panel-heading">Example</div>
<div class="panel-body">
<table class='table'>
	<tr><th>This year you gave</th><th>Which means that you achieved</th></tr>
	<tr><td>£100 to Schistosomiasis Control Initiative</td><td>200 children dewormed, and an extra year of education for 10 children</td></tr>
	<tr><td>£200 to Project Healthy Children</td><td>4000 people with stronger nutrition thanks to supplementation of staple foods</td></tr>
	<tr><td>£500 to Make a Wish Foundation</td><td>Your donation, together with another eleven of the same size, allowed one child with a life-threatening illness to have their wish come true</td></tr>

The SoGive platform is a social media enabled platform -- you can link to facebook and twitter and let your friends know about the good you achieve in the world. We believe in being open and proud about your achievements with charitable giving - we don’t want you to hide your light under a bushel! But if you prefer to stay quiet about charity activity, it's your choice.

There is no charge for using SoGive to see your impact on the world. If you make payments through SoGive, we will take a small percentage to help cover the costs of running the service, and this percentage will be less than the leading charitable giving platform.
