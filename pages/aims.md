# Our aims

 - We hope to help people to see what happens when they give to charity, bringing to life their donations.
 - We want to make it easy for donors to shop around for the charities that will enable them to best achieve what they want to achieve with their giving
 - We want people to be open and proud about what they have achieved with their charitable giving, and be willing to share it freely with their friends, rather than hiding their philanthropic light under a bushel (but if you want to hide under a bushel, thatâ€™s cool too!).
