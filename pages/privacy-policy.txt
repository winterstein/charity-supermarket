# Privacy Policy

Version: 1.0

## We will respect and protect your privacy

We promise:

 - Your data belongs to you.
 - We will never sell or share your private information with a third party without your agreement (unless we are required to do so by law).
 - No SoGive person will look at your private information, unless it's to fix an issue in the system. 
Our staff all sign non-disclosure agreements.
 - You can delete your data from our systems (unless we are required to keep it by law or for audit purposes).

In using SoGive, you agree:

 - You authorise SoGive to store information relating to your account, including the use of browser cookies.
 - Anonymous data is OK. We can use data from your account in anonymised analysis, and the results belong to us. For example, we might 
 produce a report for the charities, helping them understand the pattern of donations in a sector.
 - Whilst you are a user, you authorise SoGive to use data from your account within our services.
 - We can contact you as part of the services we supply, e.g. to tell you about new features.
 - If you submit content to a public part of the site then you grant us an open licence to use, reproduce, adapt and publish that content. An example would be posting a public comment on a blog we host. This does not affect private content, which remains private.

SoGrow will ask you to authorise access to sites such as Twitter using a secure system called OAuth. 
This means you don't have to give us your password. You can revoke OAuth access at any point. 
E.g. for Twitter, you do that at http://twitter.com/account/connections.
