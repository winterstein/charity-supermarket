# What is Charity Supermarket?

Charity Supermarket is a tool that lets you see the impact you’ve made in the world through your charitable giving. Using our independent analysis, we will show you the impact that you achieved with your donation. Furthermore, by using data-driven analysis, we can help you see which are the best giving opportunities.

<div class="panel panel-default">
<div class="panel-heading">Example</div>
<div class="panel-body">
<table class='table'>
	<tr><th>This year you gave</th><th>Which means that you achieved</th></tr>
	<tr><td>£100 to Schistosomiasis Control Initiative</td><td>200 children dewormed, and an extra year of education for 10 children</td></tr>
	<tr><td>£200 to Project Healthy Children</td><td>4000 people with stronger nutrition thanks to supplementation of staple foods</td></tr>
	<tr><td>£500 to Make a Wish Foundation</td><td>Your donation, together with another eleven of the same size, allowed one child with a life-threatening illness to have their wish come true</td></tr>

The Charity Supermarket platform is a social media enabled platform -- you can link to facebook and twitter and let your friends know about the good you achieve in the world. We believe in being open and proud about your achievements with charitable giving - we don’t want you to hide your light under a bushel! But if you prefer to stay quiet about charity activity, it's your choice.

There is no charge to get access to Charity Supermarket's analysis. If you make payments through Charity Supermarket, we will take a small percentage to help cover the costs of running the service; this is a practice followed by a number of the other main charitable giving platforms.
